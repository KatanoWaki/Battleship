Story
------------------------------------------------------------------

You are the captain of a battleship called the USS Iowa. Your radar is down, you are cut off from your fleet, and you are surrounded by enemy ships. You need to make a quick retreat to regoup with your fleet. 

You just have to land one shot with your massive 16" Mark 7 guns to disrupt and break through the blockade of enemy ships. The problem is that your ammo stores are running low after the last 2 days of battles, so pick your shots wisely.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation / Running
------------------------------------------------------------------
Install the game by extracting the battleship.py to any directory. 

Open a terminal/console and use command 'python3 battleship.py' or './battleship.py' in Linux/Unix/Mac to start the game.

How to Play
------------------------------------------------------------------

Set up your game by answering the questions. For a speedy game setup, just press enter at the prompts to select the defaults. The defaults are in parenthesis ().

Ships:
	This is how many ships will be in the ocean for you to aim for. This also determines how large the battlefield is. 

Shots:
	This is how much ammo you have left in your magazine. This determines how many turns you have to score a direct hit on an enemy ship. Once you are out of ammo the enemy will swarm in and sink your ship. This also determines how difficult the game is. The default is medium, a lower number is more difficult and a higher number is easier. 

You can also type "help" or "h" at any prompt to see a list of other useful and fun commands, including automated gameplay and a cheat mode.

Good luck, Captain.
